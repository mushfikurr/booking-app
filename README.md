## Why?
As a person who is always visiting local business' (thanks Jay!), I was surprised to see they were still operating through mobile phone and text. 

Though there are many services that offer this service, many:
- Fail to properly address the wants of a local business, often being hard to create.
- Overcharge for the service.
- Are built on older technologies.

This is what Bookal aims to solve.
